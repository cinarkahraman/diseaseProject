## Introduction
This project aims to classify tomato and potato leaves using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Our goal is to evaluate the performance of these models in accurately identifying the type of leaf based on images.

## Project Overview
We developed an application that utilizes CNN and DNN techniques to classify images of tomato and potato leaves. This README provides an overview of our approach, the datasets used, the models implemented, and the results obtained from our experiments.

## Dataset
We used a dataset consisting of labeled images of tomato and potato leaves. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets to train and evaluate our models effectively.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village/data)

## Models
We implemented two types of models for leaf classification: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The DNN model is a traditional feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers.

## Implementation
We implemented our models using Python and the TensorFlow framework. The code is structured into modules for data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## Results
Our experiments yielded promising results in leaf classification accuracy. Both CNN and DNN models achieved high accuracy rates on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for this task.
